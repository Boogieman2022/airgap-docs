## Difference between same device approach vs. offline device

The offline approach focuses on the highest security available by storing your secret on a truly offline device with no connections to any network whatsoever. Ensuring that the secret is kept as safe as possible but with a caveat that the QR communication might be more cumbersome to use. This should be used as cold storage of larger funds.

The same devices approach brings still a lot of added security in comparison with other mobile wallets. With the two app approach, the secret is encapsulated and protected through the permission handling of the operating system e.g. no network permission for AirGap Vault. The communication between the two apps is easier to use thanks to simple app switching. This is intended to manage smaller funds or used to interact with decentralized applications.

## I have sent a transaction but it does not go through

Sometimes transactions might take longer to be confirmed by the network. When creating a transaction in AirGap Wallet a fee is calculated depending on your preference between slow & cheap and fast & expensive.

If you go to your account e.g. Tezos, you will see an entry below “Pending Transaction”. You can take a look at the block explorer to understand more about the status, by selecting the transaction and then “Open Blockexplorer”.

If you have waited for a few hours and the transaction still hasn’t been confirmed. You can recreate the transaction again in AirGap Wallet, this time you can either use fast & expensive or set your own fee. Go through the signing process with AirGap Vault and broadcast the transaction with AirGap Wallet.

## How can I participate in Staking?

AirGap supports Staking for various protocols through the “Delegation” functionality. You will delegate your funds to a validator that will take part in the validation of the network you and the validator will receive rewards for providing this stake.

To start delegating and receive rewards:

1. Select your account e.g. Tezos
2. Select “Delegation”
3. Click “Delegate”
4. Go through the transaction signing process with AirGap Vault
5. You’re now delegated a will earn rewards

Supported Staking protocols:

- Tezos
- Cosmos
- Polkadot
- Kusama

## I have undelegated my ATOMs (Cosmos) but cannot transfer them?

If you’ve undelegated your ATOMs (Cosmos) you will have to wait for 21 days until they become transferable again. You will see the date when you will be able to transfer your ATOMs (Cosmos) again in AirGap Wallet under “Delegation”.

## Why am I not receiving rewards for my Tezos delegation?

When delegating Tezos from a new account a period of 12 cycles equaling about 36 days need to pass until you will be eligible for the first reward.

In Tezos a baker (validator) pays out rewards manually, this means that you might receive rewards not right after the first minute of a new cycle but rather a bit later.

If you’re not receiving rewards for a long time, reach out to the baker (validator) directly. If you’ve not chosen any other baker in AirGap, you’ve delegated to us and can reach us with any questions at hi@airgap.it

Keep in mind that you can still transfer your XTZ (Tezos) during that time as Tezos.

## Why am I not receiving rewards for my Cosmos delegation?

When delegating ATOMs (Cosmos) you will need to manually claim your rewards.

1. Open AirGap Wallet
2. Select your ATOM (Cosmos) account
3. Select “Delegation”
4. Select the “Rewards” tab and then click on “Claim Rewards”
5. Go through the transaction signing process with AirGap Vault and broadcasting with AirGap Wallet
6. You’ve unlocked your rewards
