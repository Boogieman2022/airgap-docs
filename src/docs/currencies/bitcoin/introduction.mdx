## What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin was the first decentralized digital currency based on blockchain technology. It was created in 2008 by a mysterious and anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the white paper in a cryptography mailing list and later open-sourced the software that implements the protocol.
