## What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin was the first decentralized digital currency based on blockchain technology. It was created in 2008 by a mysterious and anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who released the white paper in a cryptography mailing list and later open-sourced the software that implements the protocol.

### Supported format of bitcoin address
- #### Legacy address format- Supported:
The original Bitcoin format. This format is not scalable so, it tends to have higher transaction fees than other formats. It is unable to communicate with Segwit addresses. Start with "1", example 13jw7krcy7rzvfeNmQaEyMCueSKnqZm1Z7.

- #### SegWit address format- Supported:
The Segwit address format is an improvement for the scalability of the legacy address format. Because SegWit is more scalable, it comes with way cheaper fees. Start with "bc1q", example bc1q60vkdsn37kk9xgm5vw0jasrxw8lsrx68rqwr2g.

- #### Taproot - [Coming soon]


- #### Compatibility address format - Not Supported
This format was introduced to solve the compatibility issue between Legacy and Segwit addresses. We currently do not support this format, but we may consider looking into it in the future. Start with "3", example 363SHUfZ4rv2F631EhwzcxUNVKL7Q5JEz6.
