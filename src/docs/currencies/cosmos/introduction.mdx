## Introduction
Cosmos is a blockchain that powers an ecosystem of blockchains designed to scale and interoperate with each other. 
Cosmos aims to make it simple for developers to create blockchains while also breaking down barriers between blockchains by allowing them to communicate with one another. The ultimate goal is to build an Internet of Blockchains, a network of blockchains that can connect in a decentralized manner.
