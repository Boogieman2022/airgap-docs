Polkadot is a scalable layer zero blockchain solution.
Polkadot aims to bring interoperability so that different blockchains with different functionalities can communicate in a strong-shared, secured environment. A practical example would be a contract event on the Ethereum network that would result in a payment on the Tezos network, cross-chain swap of Cosmos to Solana using smart contracts, and no third party or intermediaries.

DOT is the official coin of the Polkadot ecosystem. DOT is to the Polkadot what ETH is to the Ethereum network. DOT has three main functions in Polkadot.
- Governance for the network
- Staking for the operation of the network
- Creating parachains by bonding DOT.
