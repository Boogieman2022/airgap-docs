If you hold DOT in AirGap, you can stake them to earn rewards. See the following guide for more info: [coming soon]

:::caution Minimum Delegation
There is currently a minimum amount of DOT required for each nomination. The threshold is currently around 250 DOT and is changing daily. Use this (unofficiall) website to see the current threshold: https://polkaview.network/dot If you delegate an amount below that threshold, you will not receive rewards!
