## Introduction to Kusama

Just like Polkadot, Kusama is a scalable layer zero blockchain solution with its native token, KSM.
Kusama has a similar codebase as Polkadot with some slight improvements. Kusama is much faster, with an approximate speed increase of 4x.
Kusama is an experimental development environment for developers, making it ideal for projects who want to move fast and innovate on Kusama before preparing for deployment on Polkadot. Kusama basically acts as a canary network for Polkadot. [Learn more](https://kusama.network/)

### AirGap Kusama Wallet

AirGap Kusama Wallet is a convenient way to store and transfer KSM while storing your private key offline. AirGap also provides an interface to stake and delegate your KSM to a validator.

### Kusama Account

#### Create a KSM account

When you create a Kusama account, The account does not exist yet on-chain.

#### Activate your KSM account

To activate an account you need an existential deposit, which is 0.000033333 KSM. After depositing a minimum of 0.000033333 KSM, your address becomes recorded on-chain.

#### Reaped account

When your account goes below 0.000033333 KSM, it will be reaped, thereby wiped from the blockchain's state to conserve space.
Going below 0.000033333 KSM causes an account to be reaped. It can be reactivated by redepositing at least 0.000033333 KSM.
AirGap prevents your account from going below 0.000033333 KSM to avoid this scenario.

### How to set up a KSM account.

This guide uses XTZ as an example, but the same steps can set up Kusama in AirGap.
