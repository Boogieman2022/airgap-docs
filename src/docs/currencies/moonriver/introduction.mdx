## Introduction to Moonriver 

Moonriver is a companion network to Moonbeam and serves as a canary network. It is an L1 solution built on kusama and serves as a testing environment. New codes are first deployed to Moonriver, where they can be tested and validated in real-world economic conditions. The same code is then deployed to Moonbeam on Polkadot.

MOVR is the utility token of the Moonriver Network, and it serves the following functions: 
- Payment for transactions fees.
- Payment for the execution of smart contracts
- Incentivizing collators to produce blocks to keep the network running efficiently.
- Facilitation of Moonriverâ€™s on-chain governance system.
