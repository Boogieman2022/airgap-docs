## Introduction to Ethereum 
Ethereum goes beyond peer-to-peer payment. It is a global, open-source environment for decentralized applications.
Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum is the worldâ€™s leading programmable blockchain.
Ether is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum (ETH). Many of the properties of ETH are similar to those of Bitcoin. It is entirely digital and can be instantly sent to anyone, anywhere in the world. [Learn more](https://ethereum.org/).
