## What is the difference between a "Secret", "Seed Phrase", "Recovery Key" and "Password"?

- We refer to the "Secret" as the 24 words you get when setting up a new Vault. This is also commonly referred to as a "Seed Phrase" or "Mnemonic". Those 24 words are everything you need to recover your funds in case you lose access to your Vault.

- The "Recovery Key" is a key that is only used on Android. On Android, it is possible that the device randomly wipes the secure storage where your seed phrase is stored. If this happens, you have 2 options. You can either import your 24 words again, then the "Recovery Key" is not needed. Or you can enter the "Recovery Key", which will restore your 24 words.

:::caution
The "Recovery Key" can only be used together with the Vault where it was set up. If your Vault is lost or defective, the "Recovery Key" will NOT allow you to access your funds. For that, you need a backup of your **24 words**.
:::

- The "Password" can optionally be set when adding a Secret. This will allow you to set an additional password that is required every time the Vault accesses your Secret to generate accounts or sign transactions. This password will **NOT** allow you to recover your funds in case you lose your 24 word backup.

- The "Passphrase" (sometimes also known as "25th word" or "BIP39 passphrase) can optionally be set when creating an account. This is an advanced feature. Only use it if you understand how it works.

## Why is [Insert Coin Name] not supported?

Our main focus is **security**. Adding new coins can decrease security if it's not done carefully. When we integrate a coin, we usually do a security audit or have the code reviewed by a third party. This requires us to work with some kind of entity behind those coins to fund development and ensure continuous support of the currency.

We hope that once the project gains more traction, more projects will reach out to us to work together on the integrations.

<!-- Thank you for reaching out to us. Currently we don't have any concrete plans on supporting ___. If there is interest from the community we normally work together with an entity in the ecosystem of the protocol that supports AirGap in terms of resources for development and security audits. If you're aware of such an entity, it would be great if you could position AirGap there. -->

## Reproducible builds

The builds of `AirGap Vault` are **reproducible**. This means that the app downloaded from the Play Store match the source code that is published on GitHub. If this is not the case, it means that there could be hidden malicious code in the published version that is not visible in the published source code.

The independent website [WalletScrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/android/it.airgap.vault/) examines a wide variety of cryptocurrency wallets to determine their reproducibility. We're happy to say that AirGap Vault was one of the first wallets to be marked as "reproducible".

:::tip
The `AirGap Wallet` is application is also rerpoducible, but it is not checked for reproducibility by WalletScrutiny because it doesn't contain any private keys.

:::tip
iOS applications cannot be checked for reproducibility because of the was Apple processes the Apps during their release process.

## Use vault as offline device

In theory, the security is slightly better if the device has never been online and used before. The reason for this is that "malware" could have infected your phone while it was online, and that malware could tamper with AirGap once it is installed, even if the phone is offline.

We recommend that you factory reset your phone before using it as your air-gapped, offline, device. Usually, you do have to quickly connect your phone to the internet after the reset to be able to download the app from the app store. But this is fine, because you are not installing any potentially dangerous apps on your phone during this time. If you have an android device with an SD Card slot, you can copy the Vault .apk file using the SD Card so you don't have to connect to the internet. After you have the app on your phone, disable wifi, bluetooth, mobile data and put it into airplane mode.

## Security

The security concept behind air-gapped systems is to work with two physically separated devices, one of which has no connection to the outside world or any network. In the context of AirGap, the component which has no internet connection is the AirGap Vault. The two components, AirGap Vault and AirGap Wallet, communicate through one-way communication using QR codes.

## Supply Chain attacks

In the past years, mutliple cryptocurrency wallets have been targeted by attackers to try and steal users funds. One common attack vector is the supply chain attack. In this attack, the attacker tries to compromise a dependency that is used in the wallet and use it to inject malicious code. At AirGap, we take utmost care of evaluating the dependencies we use. We have also introduced a system that separates the dependencies used during testing and development from the dependencies that are used to build and run the project. This reduces the risk of malicious code injection during the build and test steps.

### Security Audits

The application as a whole, as well as multiple components, have been audited by different third party companies.

**All audits have found no way of extracting the private key from AirGap Vault.**

The security audits, as well as explanations of our remediations can be found [here](https://medium.com/airgap-it/airgap-third-party-security-audit-bcb18deb9ca9).

### Secure Secret Generation

#### Additional Entropy

The entropy seeder uses the native secure random generator provided by the device and concatenates this with the sha3 hash of the additional entropy (audio, video, touch, accelerometer). The rationale behind this is:

- The sha3 hashing algorithm is cryptographically secure, such that the following holds: `entropy(sha3(secureRandom())) >= entropy(secureRandom())`
- Adding bytes to the sha3 function will never lower entropy but only add to it, such that the following holds: `entropy(sha3(secureRandom() + additionaEntropy)) >= entropy(sha3(secureRandom()))`
- By reusing the hash of an earlier "round" as a salt, we can incorporate the entire collected entropy of the previous round
- Native secure random cannot be fully trusted because there is no API to check the entropy pool it's using

The algorithm being used for the entropy seeding:

```typescript
const ENTROPY_BYTE_SIZE = 256;
let entropyHashHexString = null;

function toHexString(array) {
  return array
    .map(function (i) {
      return ("0" + i.toString(16)).slice(-2);
    })
    .join("");
}

function seedEntropy(additionalEntropyArray) {
  const secureRandomArray = new Uint8Array(ENTROPY_BYTE_SIZE);
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(secureRandomArray);
  console.log(
    entropyHashHexString +
      toHexString(secureRandomArray) +
      toHexString(additionalEntropyArray)
  );
  entropyHashHexString = sha3_256(
    entropyHashHexString +
      toHexString(secureRandomArray) +
      toHexString(additionalEntropyArray)
  );
  return entropyHashHexString;
}
```

<!-- ## Recommended Devices

## AirGap vs Hardware Wallets

// TODO: Comparison Matrix?

1. AirGap Vault is completely air-gapped. This means that there is no physical (or wireless) connection between your private key and the internet. With other HW wallets, you always have a cable where you don't see what's happening (your computer could be sending thousands of commands to the HW wallet to try and exploit it, you simply don't know).

2. The big screen of the Vault allows you to see much more details about a transaction. You don't have to see it on a tiny screen and click through multiple pages to verify the basic data. This increases security.

3. You are more protected against targeted supply chain attacks. When buying a HW wallet (especially second hand), you always have a risk that the hardware was modified maliciously (eg. to give you a non-random seed phrase that the attacker knows and can steal from). Using a phone doesn't fully protect you against it, but because nobody knows that you are using it specifically for this purpose, I would argue it's a lot harder to actually do it.

4. Privacy. A couple of months ago, the ledger database with millions of emails and hundreds of thousands of phone numbers and addresses were leaked. Those people are now targeted via email, via phone, or could even be attacked in their homes. Our wallet can be installed on any phone. You don't have to register anywhere or tell anyone that you are using AirGap.

5. In case someone breaks into your house, an old phone will probably not be taken because it doesn't have a lot of value and is usually trackable via GPS. Nobody will expect that it might hold bitcoins. Whereas if they find a HW wallet, they will for sure take it (and maybe even be motivated to search for the recovery key somewhere in your room).

One last thing that I will not list as a "pro" or "con", because people have different opinions about it:

HW wallets are very specific devices. This means they serve a "single" purpose and can only include what's necessary. This reduces the attack surface. But at the same time, those HW wallets are usually developed by small teams, whereas phones (and their software) are developed by multi-billion dollar companies. While the attack vector is bigger, they also have a lot more resources to make their product secure (both hardware and software). -->
