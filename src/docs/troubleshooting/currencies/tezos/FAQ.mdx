## Why am I not receiving rewards for my Tezos delegation?

When delegating Tezos from a new account a period of 12 cycles equaling about 36 days need to pass until you will be eligible for the first reward.

In Tezos a baker (validator) pays out rewards manually, this means that you might receive rewards not right after the first minute of a new cycle but rather a bit later.

If you’re not receiving rewards for a long time, reach out to the baker (validator) directly. If you’ve not chosen any other baker in AirGap, you’ve delegated to us and can reach us with any questions at hi@airgap.it

Keep in mind that you can still transfer your XTZ (Tezos) during that time as Tezos.
