Sapling (Tezos) is a complex feature. If you ever run into any issues (eg. the balance is wrong), we will not be able to help you because all transactions are private.

## What is Sapling
Sapling or shielded transactions allows you to perform privacy-preserving transactions of fungible tokens in a decentralized environment. It was an original idea from the Electric Coin Company, the company behind the ZCash protocol and it has long been the gold standard for transaction protection in blockchain, whereby the confidentiality of the sums and the unlinkability of the sender and receiver are protected. This feature was recently added to the Tezos network.

## What are the use cases for Sapling
- True privacy: Due to cryptocurrency's pseudonymous nature most people believe it provides privacy for payments but in reality, it does not. In fact, crypto gives less protection than fiat monetary authorities in certain ways, since it is a public blockchain that can theoretically reveal the real identity behind a public address if someone has enough resources to do chain analysis. With the introduction of sapling, transactions can now be routed through a shielded pool thereby providing true privacy and anonymity.
