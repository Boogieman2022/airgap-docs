In this guide, we explain how a user can install, set up the Vault and Wallet and sign a transaction.

## Decisions — Do I want the maximum safety?

AirGap has two setup methods, so it is vital to decide how you intend to use AirGap before you begin the setup process.

1. The first and most secure method is the two apps, two device approach. In this method, the private key is generated and securely stored on an 
offline device with the AirGap Vault app. The companion app AirGap Wallet is installed on your everyday smartphone, which interacts with the Vault 
using a one-way communication with QR code. This method is recommended for handling large amounts of funds.

2. The second method is the two apps, single device approach. In this method, the private key is generated and securely stored in the AirGap Vault 
app and installed on the same device as the AirGap Wallet. This method is recommended for handling small amounts of funds.

## Step by Step — From installation to a successful transaction

1. Download the AirGap Vault and Wallet

3. Click the "Generate" button to create new mnemonics. You can also import existing mnemonics.

:::warning Warning
We recommend you generate new mnemonics and do not use one that has already been generated on a device that is not air-gapped. Not doing so will decrease your overall security and put all your funds at risk!.
