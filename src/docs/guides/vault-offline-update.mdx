For maximum security, we recommend that our users do not connect the device to the internet with which the vault is installed, therefore making it impossible to keep the app updated directly from the google play store.

In this guide, we outline the steps to updating the vault app without connecting your device to the internet.

- Visit our [github page](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/releases) on your PC/Laptop.

- Scroll down to the latest release info section and download the apk.

- Eject and remove your SD card from your PC/laptop and insert it into the phone with the vault installed.
