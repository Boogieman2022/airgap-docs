Watch-only wallets allow you to keep track of your cold wallet (for example, AirGap Vault, Hardware wallet, and Paper wallet) without accessing your private key. Import your extended public key and watch it directly from apps such as Sparrow Wallet or BlueWallet .

In this guide, we walk you through how to set up a watch-only wallet with BlueWallet and AirGap Vault. 

### How to set up a watch-only wallet
- Download BlueWallet from either Google Play store or Apple Store.
- Update AirGap Vault to at least version 3.12
- [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airgap-vault-secure-secrets/id1417126841?l=de&ls=1&mt=8) 
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.airgap.vault)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/airgap-it/airgap-vault/releases)
