When installing AirGap Vault on an old Android device, one common challenge is that the Webview on these old devices is not up to date. This can lead to a variety of errors (usually the App opening and just showing a white screen).

On this page, we have a quick guide on how to update the Android webview.

:::note Play Store required
To update the Android System Webview using this method, your device needs to have the Play Store App installed.
:::

1. Open the Play Store
2. Search for “Android System Webview”

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/webview/1-android-webview.png"} />

3. Click the "update" button

:::note Update button unavailable
If update button is unavailable, skip this step and repeat the same process for “Google Chrome”
:::

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/webview/2-android-webview.png"} />

Some devices (depending on the software version), use the Webview version that is provided by "Google Chrome".
Repeat the process above for "Google Chrome" as well.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/webview/3-android-webview.png"} />

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/webview/4-android-webview.png"} />

After completing those steps, AirGap Vault should run. If there are still issues, please reach out to us.
