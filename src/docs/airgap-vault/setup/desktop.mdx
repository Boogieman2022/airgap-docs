:::warning No Encryption
AirGap Vault on desktop does not encrypt the secret after importing it. We therefore do NOT recommend using AirGap Vault desktop version on an online or unencrypted computer. Running AirGap Vault on desktop should only be done by advanced users that understand the security implications of doing so.

In this guide we will describe the steps of how a secure offline device can be set up.

3. Do a factory reset
4. Set up the device and use a strong password, optionally protect the device with biometrics
5. Install AirGap Vault
6. Set device into Airplane mode and never turn it back on

You now have a secure device set up and you can proceed to set up AirGap Vault.
