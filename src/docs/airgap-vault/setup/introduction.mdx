For maximum security, AirGap Vault has to be installed on an offline device and never connected to the internet again. This ensures that the private key cannot be leaked via a USB cable or a persistent bluetooth connection. It is fully air-gapped and isolated from any network and provides the best possible security.

Preparing a mobile phone to be used as a secure offline and air-gapped cold wallet is not difficult, but it's important that best practices are followed to make sure it is as secure as it can be.
