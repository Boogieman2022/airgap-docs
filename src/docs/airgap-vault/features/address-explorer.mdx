### Verify Addresses Offline

When using HD wallets (currnently supported for BTC, ETH and GRS), it is important that addresses with different derivation paths can be verified. This is especially important for BTC where the change is always sent to a new address.

This feature can be accessed on the address detail view in the top right under "Address Explorer".
