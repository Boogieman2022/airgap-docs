title: Get Addresses from xPub

import { RunnableCode } from "@site/src/components/RunnableCode";

AirGap Wallet can currently not display additional receiving addresses after the first one.

This snippet can be used to show other receiving addresses.
To use it, open the vault and copy the "sync" request and replace the data in the snippet below.

You can use the [BIP39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) tool to verify the output by entering the extended public key there.

:::caution
Entering your extendedPublicKey online on an insecure website will reduce your privacy.
